### You can always count on me when ...

Always ready to try to help when needed, either for a technical problem or if you feel like having a chat! Cannot promise I will succeed to find the answer to your problem but I promise I will try to help you as much as I can!

### A funny story

Well I am a really clumsy person. Some years ago, I managed to let a knife fell on the foot of my husband (by accident, I swear :grimacing:) That was hopefully not a so serious injury but still, we had to go to the emergency. The doctor and nurses were really laughing at us.
We are still married today so I suppose he is not too much resentful about that...

#### TL;DR
Just don't let me go near a knife ...
